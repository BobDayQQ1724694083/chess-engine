***CHESS ENGINE***

This is a simple chess engine, with some quick and dirty functions to push pieces around the board.
The main motivation behind building this library of chess functions is to use it for competitive programming.

There is further scope of improvement like: detecting Stalemate, allow Castling and En Passant. You can fork this project and simulating a game from a PGN file.

This project has already grown to be quite big with lots of functions, and is more than able to simulate any chess game. Growing this project any further would not serve the aim of this project, therefore I leave these improvements for the hands of person who will need this chess engine to solve some chess problem. Don't forget to send pull requests if you improve this chess engine further.
