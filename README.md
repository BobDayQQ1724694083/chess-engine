This is a relatively simple chess engine, with some quick and dirty functions to push pieces around the board.
Someday, this chess engine might entertain the ideas of Deep Learning.

There is further scope of improvement like: Castling, Stalemate, En Passant, and Checkmate.
Further, pieces can be made wise in general, to not allow checkmate for their side, therefore all moves that allow your own side to be checkmated should discarded.
But I leave these improvements in the hands of person who will need this chess engine to solve some chess problem.
