This is a relatively simple chess engine, with some quick and dirty functions to push pieces around the board.
Someday, this chess engine might entertain the ideas of Deep Learning.

***There is further scope of improvement like: Castling, Stalemate, En Passant, and Checkmate.***
***Further, pieces can be made wise in general, to not allow checkmate for their side, therefore all moves that allow your own side to be checkmated should discarded, for example, a piece cannot move if it puts its own king in check.***
***But I leave these improvements for the hands of person who will need this chess engine to solve some chess problem.***
